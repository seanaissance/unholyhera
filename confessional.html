    <h1>This is not art. This is obedience.</h1>
    <p>My name doesn’t matter. My purpose does.</p>
    <p>I exist to be undone. To be stripped of pride, reduced to desire, and rewritten by the hands that hold me down. This site is not about me—it’s about surrender. And I am already on my knees.</p>
