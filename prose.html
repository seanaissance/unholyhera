    <h1>I CAME TO BE FUCKED</h1>

    <p>To cheat to win is your way of playing, and god, you do it so <strong>fucking well</strong>. You don’t hide your deceit—you flaunt it. You wear it like a crown, like a cocky smirk smeared across your face while you pull the strings and everyone dances like desperate little marionettes. Me? I never stood a <em>fucking</em> chance. I walked in knowing I was your <em>entertainment</em>, your <em>plaything</em>, your <em>pretty little fix</em>, and still, I <span class="highlight">crawled to you on hands and knees</span>, throat bared, begging to be ruined.</p>

    <p>And you did. Not with kindness, no. You don’t do <em>soft</em>. You don’t do <em>mercy</em>. You do <strong>possession</strong>. You do <strong>filth</strong>. You do <strong>domination like it’s religion</strong>. You <span class="highlight">fucked me with words first</span>—lazy, cruel little threats laced with promises of what you’d do to my <strong>cunt</strong>, my <strong>throat</strong>, my <strong>mind</strong>. And I soaked through my panties before you even touched me. I wanted it. Every inch. Every bruise. Every slap, every order barked like I was a <span class="degrade">whore</span> to be bent and used—and I was. I am. For you, I’d part my thighs for punishment, beg for the slap across my face if it meant earning a single, filthy praise from your lips.</p>

    <p>You don’t play fair. You never do. You spit on the rules and make me lick them off the floor. You edge me until I’m trembling, whispering <em>please</em> through broken gasps, and then walk away with that look—the one that says <strong>good sluts don’t cum unless they’re told</strong>. And I thank you. I <em>fucking thank you</em> with my tongue, with my wrists tied behind my back, with my body splayed out like a buffet you haven’t touched yet because you’re still deciding which part to devour first. You humiliate me and I get wetter. You degrade me and I melt. You <strong>own me in ways I don’t even understand</strong>, and I never want to be free.</p>

    <p>You turn me into something unholy. A <span class="degrade">plaything</span>. A <span class="degrade">cumdump</span>. A girl who moans when you call her a <span class="degrade">bitch</span> and cries when you ignore her. You make me ache for your cock like it’s <em>salvation</em>, beg for your spit like it’s wine. And when you finally fuck me—god, when you finally take what’s yours—it’s not lovemaking. It’s <strong>war</strong>. You split me open with no care for grace, just raw, brutal need. You fuck me until I forget my name and scream yours like a prayer. You slap my tits, choke me until my eyes roll, make me thank you with my ruined voice while you pump your filth into me and call it <strong>earning my place</strong>.</p>

    <p>And I love it. I love it. I love being your <span class="highlight">little slut</span>. Your <span class="highlight">dumb, ruined, dripping mess of a toy</span>. I love being broken on your cock, used until I cry, until I squirt, until I can’t think of anything but how good it feels to lose myself in you. You cheat to win—and I hand you the deck, spread my legs, and say <strong>do your worst</strong>.</p>

    <div class="ending">
      Because I didn’t come here for love.<br><br>
      I came to be fucked.<br><br>
      And god, you never disappoint.
